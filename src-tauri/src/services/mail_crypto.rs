//! The **format-agnostic seam** for end-to-end encrypted and signed mail
//! (`docs/mail_encryption_plan.md` §4).
//!
//! Not to be confused with [`crate::services::mail_crypt`], which encrypts the
//! local store at rest and shares nothing with this module but a prefix. This
//! one is about the *message*: what the sender did to it before it left their
//! machine.
//!
//! Two formats reduce to the same four operations, so they are declared once
//! here and implemented separately. Today only OpenPGP is implemented
//! ([`crate::services::mail_pgp`]); S/MIME is **detected but not handled**, and
//! that asymmetry is deliberate rather than an oversight — a detected-but-
//! unhandled message renders a banner saying so, which is strictly better than
//! rendering its ASN.1 blob as if it were the mail.
//!
//! # The one ordering that is not negotiable
//!
//! ```text
//! decrypt → parse → sanitize → render
//! ```
//!
//! Decryption confers **no trust whatsoever**. A decrypted body is still
//! attacker-controlled — more so, if anything, because it arrived wearing a
//! padlock — so it goes through `mail_sanitize::sanitize_message_html` exactly
//! as server-delivered content does, and lands in the same `sandbox=""` frame.
//! That frame is what makes EFAIL-class exfiltration hard: the attack is to
//! wrap a victim's ciphertext in markup whose *rendering* phones the plaintext
//! home, and it needs a renderer willing to fetch. Ours is not.
//!
//! # What the panel may and may not say
//!
//! The display vocabulary is copied from `mail_authres` on purpose
//! (`state`/`identifier`/`aligned`), because the misreading it was built to
//! prevent is the same one here: **a good signature is a statement about bytes,
//! not about a person.** `dkim=pass header.d=evil.example` on mail claiming to
//! be from a bank is a genuine pass by the wrong signer; a valid OpenPGP
//! signature from a key nobody verified is a genuine signature by an unknown
//! party. Both get the same treatment — the identity is shown next to the
//! verdict, and positive chrome requires the verdict *and* the alignment.
//!
//! And headers sit **outside** the signature in both formats. A signed message
//! does not authenticate its own `From`, `Subject` or `Date`; only its body is
//! covered. The panel therefore never implies that a green tick vouches for the
//! sender line above it.
