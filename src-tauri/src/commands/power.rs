//! AC-vs-battery power state for Energy Saver mode.
//!
//! A single read-only command backing the frontend `stores/power.ts` poller.
//! The classification is pulled out into a pure [`classify`] so it can be
//! unit-tested without a real `Manager` (which needs OS battery devices). We
//! follow the `commands::monitor` shape: a `supported` flag lets the frontend
//! degrade gracefully — when detection fails we report `supported: false` and
//! `on_battery: false` (fail open to AC) so a machine where the query breaks is
//! never left feeling sluggish.
