//! Remote images in the markdown preview.
//!
//! The renderer shows an `![](https://…)` image as a placeholder, and the app's
//! CSP (`img-src 'self' data: blob:`) means the webview could not fetch it
//! anyway. A document therefore reaches the network only when the user presses
//! "Load" on it, and then only through this command, which uses the reader
//! fetch with its document-origin rules
//! (`services::browser_engine::fetch_document_image`): https only, nothing on
//! this machine or its local network, size- and type-capped.
