# Mail encryption — why it is shaped this way

Two features that share a prefix and almost nothing else. Plan:
`docs/mail_encryption_plan.md` (and the two long derivations behind it,
`mail_encryption_plan_a.md` / `_b.md`).

- **`services/mail_crypt.rs`** encrypts the **local store**. Applies to every
  account, independent of what any correspondent supports.
- **`services/mail_crypto.rs`** + **`services/mail_pgp.rs`** handle what the
  **sender** did to a message before it left their machine.

They are sequenced, not merely ordered: the end-to-end track caches nothing and
holds private keys, and putting either into a plaintext store would make the
store key cryptographically equivalent to the mail key. `PgpKeyring::open` takes
`MailKeys` and there is no constructor that does not — the coupling is enforced
by the type, not by a convention.

## What at-rest encryption is actually for

**Not** the stolen laptop. Full-disk encryption already answers that for most
people, and the UI says so rather than implying more. What this adds is
**backups, copies, cloud-synced folders and multi-user machines** — places FDE
is not in play — plus the one thing FDE does not cover at all: someone with
*write* access to the files relocating a ciphertext.

It adds **nothing** against a live process, or anyone who can run code as the
user. That is stated in the dialog, because a security feature that oversells
itself buys behaviour changes it did not earn.

## Three decisions that carry the at-rest design

**Values are sealed, not the file.** SQLCipher was ruled out by the no-OpenSSL
invariant, but it would be the wrong shape anyway. Because every *value* is
already an envelope by the time SQLite sees it, the WAL and the freelist can
only ever contain ciphertext — there is no window in which SQLite writes
plaintext. The single exception is a store that already existed in cleartext,
which is why that migration ends in `VACUUM INTO` a **new file**: sealing values
with `UPDATE` leaves every old subject line in the freelist, readable with a hex
editor.

**XChaCha20-Poly1305, nonce drawn at random.** The 192-bit nonce is the whole
reason. AES-GCM's 96-bit nonce is too small to draw randomly, so it needs a
counter — a counter that must survive both a crash and a restore-from-backup,
and that is how nonce reuse actually happens in the field. A restored backup here
re-derives nothing and reuses nothing.

**Every ciphertext is bound to its row by AAD.** This is the part at-rest
encryption is famous for leaving open. Without it, an attacker with disk write
access copies message A's sealed body onto message B's row and the client renders
it as B — no key broken; the tag is simply valid for the wrong row. It costs one
string concatenation, and
`mail_crypt::tests::a_sealed_value_cannot_be_relocated_to_another_row` plus the
store-level twin are what keep it true.

## Consequences you will hit while working on it

**A sealed column cannot carry a `UNIQUE`.** Randomized AEAD means two seals of
one folder path differ, so `UNIQUE (account_id, path)` would stop deduplicating
and every sync would insert the folder again. Schema v2 moves the constraint onto
`folders.path_key`, a keyed digest (`mail_crypt::name_digest`) sitting in
cleartext beside the sealed value. It leaks equality and only equality — exactly
what declaring the constraint already asserts.

**Blob ids are keyed, not bare digests.** `SHA-256(plaintext)` did two bad things
at once: it was a confirmation oracle (hash a file you suspect somebody received,
look for its name in a directory listing), and it could not have survived
sealing, because a digest of the *ciphertext* is never stable. `HMAC-SHA256
(k_addr, plaintext)` keeps dedupe and is meaningless without the key. Still 64
hex characters, so `get_blob`'s validation is untouched.

**Search cannot use `LIKE`.** There is nothing to match against but ciphertext.
Blind indexes were rejected outright — a deterministic per-token fingerprint
leaks word frequency and answers "does this mailbox contain word X", which is
most of what the encryption was for. What is left is bounded decrypt-on-scan
(50 000 rows), and the page reports `scanned` when it stopped so the UI can say
*"searched the most recent N messages"*. A truncated answer that looks complete
is the one thing a search must never produce.

**An unreachable key degrades; it does not lock the mailbox.** A locked Secret
Service collection reads identically to "nothing saved" and can block a read
forever — the failure class `remote_credentials::read_timed` already exists for,
and which once left this app's connection lamps permanently amber. Here it opens
an *ephemeral* store: `:memory:` index, blobs in a temp directory sealed under a
key that dies with the process. Mail syncs and reads; nothing persists. It looks
exactly like a working mailbox until the next launch, which is why
`MailEncryptionState` reports it and the pane shows an interrupting strip.

**What stays readable on disk**, by design: message counts, folder structure,
arrival dates, sizes, read/starred/priority flags — they are what paging,
ordering and unread counts run on. One item is sharper than "folder structure"
sounds and is pinned by a test rather than left implicit: a folder id is an
**unkeyed** `sha256(path)[..8]`, so a wordlist recovers which folders exist.
Keying it would mean re-deriving every message id, which is also every AAD row
key — a stated cost, not an oversight.

## The end-to-end half

**One ordering is non-negotiable: `decrypt → parse → sanitize → render`.**
Decryption confers no trust whatsoever. A decrypted body is if anything *more*
attacker-controlled than a plain one, because it arrived wearing a padlock and
may have been encrypted *to* the victim by the attacker — so it goes through the
same structural caps, the same `sanitize_message_html`, and the same `sandbox=""`
frame. `tests/mail_hostile_crypto.rs` is the fixture that proves it.

**Decrypted plaintext is never written to disk.** Not to `bodies_cache`, not to a
blob, not to `preview`. If it were, the store key would become cryptographically
equivalent to the PGP private key and the end-to-end guarantee would collapse
into the at-rest one. An encrypted message is therefore re-fetched and
re-decrypted on every open.

**Curve25519 only, and that is a security decision.** `pgp` depends on `rsa`
unconditionally; RUSTSEC-2023-0071 (Marvin timing oracle) is unpatched, and no
feature gates it out, so the `cargo audit` finding is permanent. But the oracle
is in RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 **decryption**, and nobody can encrypt to a key we do not
have — so generating Curve25519 keys means the vulnerable code is compiled in and
never run for our mail. RSA stays *importable*: a correspondent's key is only ever
used to verify.

**Verified vs merely known.** OpenPGP has no certificate authority. There is no
`webpki` to lean on and nothing asserting that a key belongs to a person — trust
comes from the user having compared a fingerprint out of band, and from nothing
else. So an imported key is `Known`, only an explicit "I checked this" promotes
it, and **only `Verified` *and* address-aligned earns positive chrome**. Drop the
middle clause and a padlock goes to whoever last emailed you a key; drop the last
and it goes to anyone with *a* verified key signing as anyone they like.

**Headers are outside the signature, in both formats.** A signed message does not
authenticate its own `From`, `Subject` or `Date`. The backend emits a
`headers-not-signed` note for every signed message precisely so the panel cannot
forget to say it.

**`signed_part_bytes` is the most dangerous function in the feature**, because
its failure is silent *and positive*: a verifier fed the wrong bytes reports a
pass over something the sender never signed. It slices the raw message (RFC 3156
signs the part **including its MIME headers**, in its **transfer-encoded** form)
and drops the CRLF that introduces the closing boundary.
`a_wrapped_signed_message_verifies_after_a_round_trip_through_mime` is the test
that would catch a mistake there — every other signature test feeds the verifier
the same buffer the signer saw.

**Sign inside, then encrypt.** The other ordering lets anyone strip the signature
and re-sign the same ciphertext as their own, so it would attest to who
*forwarded* the message rather than who wrote it.

**A sealed send never falls back to plaintext.** A missing recipient key is an
error naming the address. A silent downgrade is the single worst thing an
encryption feature can do, because it looks exactly like success — which is also
why the composer asks which recipients lack a key *while the message is being
written* rather than on Send.

**IMAP `APPEND` lands last, deliberately.** Before it there was no Sent copy at
all, which was accidentally the most private behaviour available; adding it
*without* encrypt-to-self is precisely how a plaintext Sent copy of an encrypted
message ships. It appends the bytes that were actually sent, and a failed APPEND
never reports a failed send — the message is already delivered, and saying
otherwise is how one gets sent twice.

**Inline (pre-MIME) signatures are reported, not checked.** The cleartext-
signature framework has its own dash-escaping and canonicalization rules, and a
verifier that got them subtly wrong would report passes over text nobody signed.
Named honestly beats checked badly.

**S/MIME is detected and deferred.** No certificate is issued to the user, so the
track has no credential to load. Detection still ships, because a
recognized-but-unsupported format renders a banner while an unrecognized one
renders its ASN.1 blob as though it were the mail. The `MailCrypto` trait exists
so un-deferring it is an added implementor, not a fork of the message pipeline —
and the plan's finding that `rustls-webpki` (already in the bundle) is a
perfectly good email-certificate validator remains correct and free.

## The one thing that has not happened

**None of this has run against a real server or a real correspondent.** The mail
client underneath it had no live QA either. Interop with Thunderbird and Outlook,
unlock latency, keychain-locked behaviour and the migration of a store that
actually holds mail are all manual and all outstanding.
