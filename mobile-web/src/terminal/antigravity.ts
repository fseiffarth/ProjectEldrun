/**
 * Google Antigravity's own screens (`agy` 1.2.7), for a tab whose label names
 * it: the model and reasoning effort its footer prints, and the `Switch Model`
 * dialog `/model` opens.
 *
 * Neither is the shape the other readers know. This is what the CLI draws,
 * captured from a live session:
 *
 *   >                                      ← the input box, above the dialog
 *   Switch Model
 *
 *     Search:

 *     Gemini 3.8 Flash
 *   > Gemini 3.6 Flash             (current)
 *     Claude Sonnet 4.6 (Thinking)
 *
 *     Effort  ◂        ●━━━━━━━━━━━━━━◉──────────────○        ▸
 *                     low          medium          high
 *               Balanced speed and reasoning quality for most tasks
 *     [1-6 of 7 items]
 *
 *   Keyboard: ↑/↓ Navigate  ←/→ Effort  enter Select  esc Go Back
 *   ? for shortcuts                           Gemini 3.6 Flash · medium
 *
 * Three things follow from it, and all three are why the model chip read
 * "Gemini" and `/model` opened an empty sheet:
 *
 *   - The rows carry no numbers, and the dialog marks its highlight with the
 *     same `>` the input box draws — so `selectPrompt` recognized nothing, and
 *     what it *would* have recognized as an input line is a model row. The
 *     dialog is found by its heading instead, and its rows are numbered here,
 *     by their place in the dialog's own list (`[1-6 of 7 items]`).
 *   - Model and effort are one dialog, not two steps: the slider belongs to the
 *     row the highlight is on and Enter applies both at once. It is drawn only
 *     for the highlighted model, and models differ in what they offer (Gemini
 *     3.1 Pro has low and high, a Claude model has no slider at all), so the
 *     stops can only be read once the highlight has arrived. That is what makes
 *     the phone's two-step sheet the honest shape: tap the model, let the
 *     dialog redraw, tap the effort it then offers.
 *   - The footer prints model and effort as one right-aligned column, where
 *     `statusLine`'s model *tokens* matched "Gemini" and dropped the rest.
 *
 * Everything here is read off the screen. What is pressed is the caller's.
