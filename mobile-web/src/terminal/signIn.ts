/**
 * Reads an agent CLI's browser sign-in off the live screen, so the phone can
 * finish it: `/login` in Claude Code, Copilot's device code, Codex's
 * "Sign in with ChatGPT", Gemini's and Qwen's `/auth`, Antigravity's and
 * Cursor's launch-time sign-in.
 *
 * Every one of them prints a URL and then waits in one of four ways, and the
 * way is read off the URL and the lines around it — nothing per CLI:
 *
 *   - `device`   the page asks for a short code the CLI printed
 *                (`ABCD-1234`); the CLI polls until it is entered there.
 *   - `code`     the page ends on a code to paste back into the session
 *                (Claude's `Paste code here if prompted >`, Gemini's
 *                "Enter the authorization code").
 *   - `callback` the page redirects to `http://localhost:<port>/…` — the
 *                CLI's own listener on the desktop. On the phone that
 *                redirect fails, and the address it failed on is what the
 *                desktop relays to the listener (`sign_in.rs`).
 *   - `wait`     none of those: the CLI polls its provider until the page
 *                says yes.
 *
 * A CLI that sends its page to the desktop's browser and prints no link
 * (Mistral Vibe) hands it over when asked to copy it: `readHiddenSignIn`
 * finds the key to ask with, `copiedSignIn` reads the OSC 52 copy that
 * answers.
 *
 * Only a URL that carries an OAuth or device-login marker counts — a link in
 * an answer is not a sign-in — and only near the bottom of the screen, where
 * the CLI is waiting. Nothing here sends keystrokes.
