/**
 * The Focus view's append-only memory of session lines — what makes "Show
 * earlier output" possible without re-walking the whole xterm buffer on every
 * frame.
 *
 * It works because scrollback rows above the live screen are immutable: xterm
 * only ever appends at the bottom and trims from the top. So each row is
 * converted to readable lines exactly once, when it leaves the tail window,
 * and the result is kept in frozen chunks the view can memoize and reveal
 * lazily. Only the tail — the live screen plus a small margin — is rebuilt per
 * frame, where the old whole-screen build re-walked 1200 rows each time.
 *
 * Buffer row indices shift when xterm trims its scrollback. The owner reports
 * each trim through {@link shiftHistory} so `end` keeps pointing at the same
 * content; line keys and chunk ids come from the monotonic `seq` counter for
 * the same reason — a `r<row>` key names a position, not a line.
