## Group M — In-App Viewers: Text / TeX / Image Enhancements (Phase 2+)
*Builds on Group D.14 (in-app file→tab viewers). Files: `src/components/embed/FileViewerPane.tsx`,
`src/components/files/markdown.ts`/`tex.ts`/`highlight.ts`, `fileUtils.ts`
(`internalViewerFor`), `src/stores/tabs.ts` (`"embed"` tab kind, `viewer`),
`src/components/embed/EmbedPane.tsx`, backend `commands/tex.rs`
(`tex_capability`/`compile_tex`), `commands/apps.rs` (`embed_capability`,
default-app resolution), `src/types/index.ts`, `README.md`.*

43. **Auto-reload the native text viewer from disk (diff-aware).** When a file
    open in the in-app text viewer changes on disk, reload it with a diff check so
    external edits (agents, git checkout, other tools) surface in the viewer.
    Don't clobber unsaved in-tab edits — detect divergence and reconcile (reload
    when clean; warn/merge-prompt when the buffer is dirty). Likely a file-watch
    or poll on the open file's mtime/hash.

44. **TeX viewer: preview off by default.** Default the TeX viewer to the source
    editor rather than auto-rendering a preview; make preview an explicit toggle.

45. **Auto-complete in native text viewers (pre-defined model).** Add code/text
    auto-completion across all native text viewers, driven by a pre-defined
    (ideally local) model. Settle the model source (local Ollama vs. configured
    global), trigger/UX, and the privacy posture (no remote calls for local-only
    projects) when picked. *Completion-length modes:* the model can be asked for a
    Sentence (current word/line), Block (current code block/paragraph), or Scope
    (whole enclosing function) completion — set per file type in settings
    (`viewer_prefs[type].autocomplete_mode`) and toggled live in-editor with
    `Shift+Tab` (cycles Sentence → Block → Scope and re-requests). The Rust
    `CompletionMode` drives both the prompt TASK hint and the `num_predict` cap
    (`commands/ollama.rs`). *Accept (while a ghost is showing):* `Tab` inserts the
    whole suggestion; `Right` (→) inserts only the next word and keeps the rest
    ghosted (walk word-by-word); `Esc` dismisses.

47. **Save icon instead of "save/saved" text (+ optional autosave).** Replace the
    textual save/saved status in the text/TeX viewer with a save icon that
    reflects dirty/clean state; consider periodic autosave (with the #43
    diff-aware reload as the counterpart for external changes).

48. **Per-file-type native-viewer settings + document supported types.** A single
    settings surface to configure native-viewer behavior keyed by file type, and
    document the supported types (and the native text viewer) in `README.md`.
    Ties into #44 (per-type preview defaults) and #45 (per-type completion).

49. **Make file links in text/TeX viewers visibly clickable.** Render links that
    point at files with a clear affordance (underline / dotted underline) so they
    read as clickable, in both the text and TeX viewers. (Companion to #50, which
    governs *where* a clicked link opens.)

50. **Link-open routing: same subwindow, or drag-to-set-default.** When a file
    link (#49) is clicked, open the target in the **same** subwindow by default;
    if the user drags the link to another subwindow, make that the default target
    **only for that file, from that linking file, for this session** — discard the
    mapping when the linking file's tab is closed (and optionally close the
    linked file(s) with it).

    an existing Tauri-side renderer before building one.

53. **Drag images (and their tabs) out as drop sources.** Make images in the image
    viewer — and image tabs — draggable as drop sources, e.g. drag an image/text
    tab and drop it into a browser file-upload field.

54. **TeX compile output → PDF in a new tab + compiler options.** Open the
    compiled PDF as its own tab (it is a real file), and add compiler options to
    the TeX viewer (output folder, engine/flags, …). Extends the existing
    `compile_tex` affordance from Group D.14.

55. **Adjustable text size in the text/TeX/Markdown editors.** Add an `A−`/`A+`
    control (and `Ctrl` +/−, `Ctrl`+0 to reset) that scales the editor font. In
    the code editors (text/TeX) the gutter and syntax/link/ghost overlay layers
    scale together via the `--code-font-size`/`--code-line-height` CSS variables;
    in Markdown it sizes the source textarea and, once set, the rendered preview
    base font. The size persists per file type in `viewer_prefs[type].font_size`
    (alongside #45's autocomplete).

66. **SyncTeX PDF↔source navigation + subtex→main compile wiring.** Make the
    compiled PDF and its `.tex` source navigable both ways, and let a child file
    build its parent. Compiles now always emit `-synctex=1` (`commands/tex.rs`).
    *Reverse search:* clicking a point in a PDF (`PdfCanvas`) runs `synctex_edit`
    and jumps the source tab to that line (via the `editorJump` store +
    `CodeEditor` `gotoLine`). *Forward search:* after a compile, `synctex_view`
    maps the source caret to a PDF box that `PdfCanvas` scrolls to and flashes
    (via the `pdfSync` store). *Subtex wiring:* a successful compile records each
    `\input`/`\include` child→root in `~/.local/share/eldrun/tex_roots.json`, and
    `resolve_tex_root` (magic `% !TEX root` comment → stored map → self) redirects
    a child's Compile to its main document. Adds a compile run animation
    (`.is-compiling` button sheen + header progress strip, reduced-motion aware).

67. **Find in the text/TeX viewers.** Add an in-editor search bar to the shared
    `CodeEditor` (so it covers both the text and TeX viewers). `Ctrl`/`Cmd`+`F`
    opens a floating find bar pinned to the editor's top-right — bound on the
    editor container so it opens whenever focus is anywhere in the tab, not only
    on the textarea. The bar has a query input (seeded from the selection), a live
    `n/total` count, `↑`/`↓` (and `Enter`/`Shift`+`Enter`) to cycle, a `Aa` match-
    case toggle, and `Esc` to close. Matches are painted by a transparent overlay
    `<pre>` layer (`decorateSearchRanges`) scroll-synced like the highlight/link
    layers, the current match brighter; navigation moves the textarea selection
    and scrolls the match into view. Pure helpers `findMatches`/`decorateSearchRanges`.

68. **Image viewer: auto-reload on disk change.** Give the image viewer the same
    diff-aware reload as the editors/PDF (#43): `useBlobUrl` polls `file_mtime`
    and re-reads the bytes when the file changes on disk, swapping the blob URL
    only once the fresh bytes are ready (no flash) and revoking the old one. An
    image regenerated by an external tool updates in place; the user's zoom/pan is
    preserved when the new image has the same dimensions, and only re-fit when the
    dimensions change.

69. **Persist viewer scroll/zoom across reopen + restart.** The in-app PDF, text,
    and image viewers remember the reader's position so reopening a file — or
    restarting Eldrun — restores it instead of jumping to the top/default zoom.
    A per-tab `ViewerState` (`scrollTop`/`scrollLeft`/`scale`/`offsetX`/`offsetY`,
    `src/stores/tabs.ts`) travels with the `embed` tab through
    `save_tab_layout`/`loadFromLayout` (round-tripped via the Rust `TabEntry`'s
    flattened `extra`, no backend change). The viewer panes
    (`FileViewerPane.tsx`, shared `useViewerState` hook) restore once on first
    load and persist (throttled) as the reader scrolls/zooms/pans; the PDF honours
    a saved zoom over fit-width on first load, and `CodeEditor` gained
    `initialScrollTop`/`onScrollPersist`. `setViewerState` merges + dedups so an
    unchanged write never churns the saveLayout debounce.

70. **TeX viewer: `Ctrl`+`S` saves and recompiles.** In the LaTeX viewer (engine
    available), `Ctrl`+`S` runs `compile()` instead of a plain save — `compile()`
    persists pending edits first, so the PDF preview tracks the source. The
    no-engine fallback keeps `Ctrl`+`S` as a plain save.

71. **Find in the native PDF viewer (`Ctrl`+`F`).** Add an in-document search bar
    to the pdf.js-backed PDF viewer (the counterpart to #67's editor search).
    `Ctrl`/`Cmd`+`F` (or the 🔍 toolbar button) opens a find bar — a static row
    below the zoom toolbar — bound on the PDF host so it opens wherever focus sits
    in the pane (the scroll area is `tabIndex=0`). It has a query input, a live
    `n/total` count, `↑`/`↓` (and `Enter`/`Shift`+`Enter`) to cycle, a `Aa` match-
    case toggle, and `Esc` to close. Each page's text is extracted lazily on first
    use via `getTextContent()` (shared `pageTextItemBoxes`, the same boxes SyncTeX
    word-refinement uses) and cached per document; the pure `pdfPageMatches`
    (`lib/viewers/tex.ts`) slices matches into big-point boxes (one per text run a
    match straddles). Matches paint as translucent overlays over the page canvases
    (`.file-viewer-pdf-search-hit`), the current one brighter and scrolled into
    view. Pure helper `pdfPageMatches`.

80. **PDF page arranging + merging, on ONE code base with the print preview.**
    Turn the read-only PDF viewer into a page organiser: reorder, delete, turn,
    duplicate and merge pages, drag pages from one open PDF viewer into another,
    and drag them **between two Eldrun windows**.

    The print preview already had half of this (a thumbnail strip that
    drag-reorders/deletes/turns pages) — it just never wrote a PDF. So rather than
    build a second page-arranger, its model and its strip were **generalised and
    shared**:

    - **`lib/viewers/pageModel.ts` — the one arrangement model.** A `PageList` of
      `PageRef{id, src, page, rot}`. Each entry carrying its own id/source/rotation
      is what the print preview's old `order: number[]` + rotations-keyed-by-page
      could not express: pages from *several* documents (merge), a duplicate turned
      independently of its twin, and multi-page moves. `print.ts`'s
      `initialOrder`/`movePage`/`removePage`/`rotatePage`/`printSequence` are gone;
      its old test cases were re-expressed against the new model, so the port is
      pinned as behaviour-preserving.
    - **`components/common/PageStrip.tsx` — the one strip.** Horizontal in the print
      preview, vertical as the PDF page rail. `printDocument` keeps its tuned
      imperative modal (iframe, WebKitGTK `@page` workarounds) and mounts the React
      strip into it via `mountPageStrip`. Print preview *gained* shift-select,
      ctrl-select, duplicate and a right-click menu for free.
    - **Writing the PDF (the missing half).** New dep `pdf-lib`, used in exactly one
      place: `pdf/pdfDoc.ts#buildPdf`, on save. Editing never rebuilds the document —
      the reader and rail render straight off the `PageList` — so a reorder is an
      array op, not a re-parse. Save writes through the existing `writeFileBytes`,
      which already routes local **and** remote/SFTP. Explicit save + full undo/redo;
      an external change while dirty raises a banner instead of clobbering either
      side. pdf.js *detaches* the buffer it is handed, so each source keeps a pristine
      byte copy for pdf-lib.
    - **Cross-window drag (`stores/pdfDrag.ts` + `commands/pdf_clip.rs`).** Two
      windows are separate WebViews with separate JS heaps, so the pages are built
      into a small PDF, parked in a backend slot, and only the *token* rides the
      event. Position comes from polling the OS cursor in physical desktop px
      (`lib/coords`), because DOM pointer events don't cross an OS window boundary on
      WebKitGTK — the same reason the tab drag-dock does it. On release every window
      gets the END carrying the last polled cursor; only the one whose rect contains
      it claims the drop and acks. Copy is the default; **Shift moves**, and the
      source deletes its pages *only* once the drop is acknowledged — so a drag
      released over empty desktop can never destroy them.
    - Merge also via a toolbar **Insert PDF…** (the project-scoped
      `ContextFilePicker` — the backend confines reads to the project tree, so an OS
      file dialog's path would simply be refused).
    - **Known limit:** pdf-lib's `copyPages` preserves page content and most
      annotations, but AcroForm fields and some tagged-PDF structure can be lost on
      rebuild. Fine for a page organiser; not a lossless editor for interactive forms.

      round-trips asserting page order/rotation in the written bytes —, `PdfPageDrag`,
      and Rust `pdf_clip`)
    - [ ] 🖐️ Manual test — **the cross-window drag is the one to watch**: it is the
      WebKitGTK-sensitive path. Also re-check the print preview still reorders/prints
      as before, and that saving works on a **remote (SSH)** project's PDF.
