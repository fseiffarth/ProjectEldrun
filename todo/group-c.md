## Group C — Workspace Switching / Platform Stability
*Files: `src-tauri/src/platform/x11.rs`, `wayland_kde.rs`, `null.rs`, `services/window_service.rs`, `services/project_runtime.rs`, `commands/workspace.rs`.*

15. **Securely move opened files/windows to the hidden workspace on switch
    (X11).** Fix the reported issue where files/windows opened in one project
    aren't reliably parked on the hidden desktop when switching. Investigate the
    move-retry logic (x11.rs ~retry 5×30ms) and window registry coverage.

16. **Make X11 workspace switching rock-solid.** Broader hardening of the
    two-desktop parking model — fix all known races/flakiness around
    show/hide/switch. (#15 is a specific symptom of this.)

17. **Preserve window z-order across switches.** Today `show_window` always
    raises to `Above` (x11.rs:120), losing stacking order. Track per-window
    z-order in the window registry/session and restore it on show.

18. **KDE Plasma i3-style workspace mode.** Explore an i3-like tiling/workspace
    behavior on KDE Plasma. Note: KDE Wayland per-window show/hide is currently a
    **no-op** (`wayland_kde.rs:74-80`) and needs KWin scripting first — this is
    research + sizable backend work.

19. **Cross-platform verification: Windows, macOS, KDE Plasma.** Verify the app
    runs and degrades gracefully where workspace backends are absent (null
    backend) and KDE works. Mostly QA + targeted fixes. OS-specific build,
    packaging, and native-window work is tracked separately in Group H (#30/#31).
