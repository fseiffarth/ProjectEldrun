/**
 * The order the Agents views (desktop `AgentSchedulesView`, phone `Activity`)
 * list agent tabs in. Shared so the two cannot disagree about what "last
 * working" means: the laptop and the phone show the same tabs, and a reader
 * who switches between them should find them in the same places.
 *
 * - `lastWorking`: what to look at next, in three tiers — a tab that has
 *   stopped to ask something, then the tabs working right now, then everything
 *   else by the last turn it finished, most recent first. The default. The
 *   tiers are the point: a question is the only thing on this list that cannot
 *   make progress without the reader, so it outranks any timestamp; a working
 *   tab needs nothing but time; and once neither applies, the newest finished
 *   answer is the one to read. Within the first two tiers the tabs keep their
 *   arrival order — a tab that is working right now has no reading that would
 *   order it (its `workingAt` is the last turn's edge, not this one's), and
 *   shuffling the questions would move them under the pointer as they arrive.
 * - `lastDone`: by the last turn each agent finished, most recent first. The
 *   triage order with no tiers over it: what finished last, whatever else the
 *   tabs are doing now.
 * - `native`: the order the list arrived in — the tab bar's on the desktop, the
 *   sidecar's (waiting first, finished last) on the phone.
 *
 * Ties (and tabs with no reading — one restored this session that has not
 * finished a turn yet) keep their arrival order, so a sort is a stable
 * reordering and a tab with nothing to say sinks to the bottom of its tier
 * rather than jumping around.
