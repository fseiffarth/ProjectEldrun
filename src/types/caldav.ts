/**
 * CalDAV accounts — the wire contract with `src-tauri/src/schema/caldav.rs`.
 *
 * Same shapes, same names, same optionality. `docs/caldav_plan.md` is the
 * design; the short version of what these types are *for*:
 *
 * An account is the **mail-account shape**, not the `source_url` shape — a
 * user-typed server, a password that is never persisted without an explicit
 * opt-in, a background interval, several accounts. `Calendar.source_url` (an
 * anonymous ICS feed) stays exactly as it was and is still the right tool for
 * a read-only link someone shared with you.
 *
 * The **events and tasks a sync produces are ordinary `CalendarEvent`s and
 * `CalendarTask`s** in `calendar.json`, carrying `caldav_href`/`caldav_etag`.
 * Nothing that renders a calendar knows this feature exists.
