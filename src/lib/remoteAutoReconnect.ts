/**
 * Wire the two *event-driven* halves of remote auto-connect that the imperative
 * connect paths can't own by themselves. The launch-time half already lives where
 * it belongs — a project's active-project auto-connect fires from `projects.load()`
 * / `setActive`, the armed VPN tunnel from `autoConnectVpnOnLaunch`. What was
 * missing is a reaction to a **tunnel coming up**:
 *
 *  1. **On any tunnel becoming active**, re-attempt the things that were only
 *     unreachable *because* the routing wasn't there yet — the active remote
 *     project (`retryAutoConnectAfterVpn`) and every armed global machine. This is
 *     what makes a project reachable *only through the VPN* connect promptly the
 *     instant the tunnel is up, instead of sitting red until the user acts. It fires
 *     whoever brought the tunnel up — the armed launch tunnel, a header connect, or
 *     another project — because a tunnel is machine-wide.
 *  2. **At launch**, sweep the global machines armed for auto-connect (the project
 *     side already self-starts from its store) — but only when the Machines feature
 *     is actually on, and only once settings have loaded to say so (`machineSweep`).
 *
 * We subscribe to the machine-level VPN store rather than poll, so the retry is
 * immediate on the exact `→ connected` transition (an earlier poll-based reaction
 * lagged the tunnel by seconds). Idempotent by construction: the retry paths skip a
 * live/winning lamp, and `setState` collapses a no-op transition, so a tunnel that
 * comes up as a *side effect* of an auto-connect (a project bringing up its own
 * VPN) can't feed back into a loop.

 * turned it on, and imported a machine list once) still had every armed host
 * dialled at launch and again on every tunnel-up, with nowhere to watch it happen
 * and nothing to stop it with. A feature that is off connects nothing.
 *
 * Gated on settings being **loaded**, not merely present: an unloaded store reads
 * as "off" for every field, so firing before it arrives would race the switch on
 * exactly the launch path this is. Waiting costs a few hundred ms; the sweep is
 * silent by construction and nothing is watching for it.
