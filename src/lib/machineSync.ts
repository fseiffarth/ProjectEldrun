/**
 * Keep a **global machine** (`stores/globalMachines`, header "Machines") and the
 * **project host** it also is (a project's primary `remote` or a `compute_hosts`
 * worker) in step, so connecting/disconnecting one reflects on the other.
 *
 * The two are never linked by id — a global machine dropped onto a project is
 * copied by *value* — so the only bridge is the **SSH target** (`user@host:port`).
 * `sameTarget` is that bridge, and the whole module keys off it.
 *
 * The physical connection really *is* shared (one OpenSSH ControlMaster per host
 * target), so "sync" is mostly reconciling the two separate status stores rather
 * than opening a second socket. Two rules keep it from looping or lying:
 *
 *  - **Global → project** is driven from **one** place: a subscription on the
 *    global store's `status`, which by contract only ever moves on a *real
 *    session* (`add`/`register`/`connect`/`disconnect` — `probeAll` writes
 *    `reachable`, never `status`). It used to hang off two hand-placed calls in
 *    `add` and `connect`, which is why `register` and the probe sweep propagated
 *    nothing and a machine could sit green in the header while the project holding
 *    the very same host stayed unconnected. One subscription cannot forget a path.
 *    Only the **active** project's pool is opened; an inactive one is left alone
 *    entirely (see `syncGlobalConnected` for why a mirrored lamp is worse than no
 *    lamp). Disconnect stays imperative — it is a teardown with an ordering
 *    (mirror first, kill jobs after), not a state a subscriber can reconstruct.
 *  - **Project → global** is a *subscription* (`initMachineSync`) that only ever
 *    *upgrades* a matching machine's lamp to `connected` — a project deactivating
 *    (which clears its lamps) must never knock an independently-connected machine
 *    offline, so `off` is deliberately not propagated upward.
 *
 * No loop: the global store's `setStatus` never touches `remoteStatus`, so the
 * subscription can't re-enter the imperative path.
