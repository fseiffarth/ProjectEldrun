 * The global Screenshot app's in-app capture seam.
 *
 * Pressing the header's Screenshot button used to always spawn an OS
 * region-capture tool. But when the thing being captured is a PDF on screen,
 * the viewer can do strictly better than a screen grab: it rasterises the
 * selected region from the rendered page canvas (document-sharp, DPR-exact,
 * with pending blackouts burned in), which is what its old ✂ toolbar tool did.
 * That tool is now armed by the Screenshot button instead of a per-viewer
 * button, so there is ONE capture entry point rather than two.
 *
 * The handshake is a synchronous, claimable window event: the launcher
 * dispatches, a visible PDF viewer claims (`detail.claimed = true`), and the
 * launcher reads the flag back to decide whether the external tool still needs
 * to run. First visible viewer wins — the flag is checked before it is set, so
 * two viewers on screen never both arm.
