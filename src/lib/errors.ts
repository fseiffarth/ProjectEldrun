/**
 * Plain-language summaries for the raw error text the backend hands the UI —
 * an `io::Error`, ssh's stderr, git's refusal, a reqwest failure. The raw text
 * is kept (`ErrorNote` shows it under "Details"); this only puts a sentence a
 * user can act on in front of it.
 *
 * Order matters: the first matching rule wins, so a specific cause sits above
 * the generic one it would also match ("Permission denied (publickey)" is an
 * SSH login problem, not a file permission; a stale backend's "command … not
 * found" is not a missing program). Anything no rule knows comes back null and
 * is shown exactly as before — an unknown error is never hidden behind a vague
 * "something went wrong".
 *
 * Rules match technical wording only (OS error numbers, errno names, tool
 * output), so an already-translated sentence set as the error passes through.
