/**
 * The TeX editor's **hover preview** (#tex-hover-preview), frontend half: rest
 * the pointer on a formula and see it typeset, without compiling the paper.
 *
 * The backend (`commands/tex.rs`'s `tex_preview_snippet`) turns a preamble plus a
 * fragment into a one-page cropped PDF; this module is everything around that
 * call, and the three things here are all about *not* running the engine:
 *
 *  - **A cache keyed by what was compiled**, not by where it sits. The key is the
 *    preamble + the snippet text, so scrolling back to a formula, or hovering the
 *    same `$\alpha$` in four paragraphs, is free — and an edit anywhere else in
 *    the document does not invalidate a single entry, which is what makes the
 *    feature usable while writing rather than only while reading.
 *  - **One compile at a time, and the newest wins.** A pointer crossing a page of
 *    equations must not queue twelve latexmk-sized jobs; a hover that has been
 *    superseded is dropped before it starts.
 *  - **Failures are cached too.** A snippet with a typo in it would otherwise be
 *    recompiled every time the pointer passed over it, which is exactly when the
 *    author is moving around fixing it.
 *
 * pdf.js is loaded with a dynamic import so a TeX tab does not pull the whole
 * renderer into its chunk (see the code-split note in `App.tsx`); a document with
 * a PDF tab open has it already.
