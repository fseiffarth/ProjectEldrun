/**
 * Copy/paste for calendar entries — the pure half.
 *
 * The whole point of the feature is the *narrowness* of what a paste changes:
 * the copy is the same appointment again on another day, so everything the user
 * typed — title, location, notes, the join URL, category, status, reminders,
 * the calendar it lives on and how long it lasts — rides along untouched, and
 * only the date (or, dropped on an hour grid, the start stamp) is new.
 *
 * Two things are deliberately NOT copied:
 *
 *  - **Identity.** `id`, `uid`, `caldav_href`/`caldav_etag` and `recurrence_id`
 *    name *this* object, here and on a CalDAV server. Carried into the copy they
 *    would make the paste push back over the original resource instead of
 *    creating a second appointment beside it. The draft omits them; the backend
 *    mints a new id and the next push is a create.
 *  - **The repeat rule.** What was copied is one occurrence — the block the user
 *    right-clicked — so the paste is one event. Carrying `rrule`/`exdates`/
 *    `overrides` over would silently clone a whole series (and its exceptions,
 *    which are keyed to dates the copy no longer has) from one right-click.
