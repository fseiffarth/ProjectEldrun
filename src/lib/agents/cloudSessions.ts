/**
 * Agent tabs that run a *cloud* session — the CLI vendor's own hosted
 * sandbox — instead of the agent in the project folder.
 *
 * Only CLIs with a launch-time entry point are listed. Several others reach a
 * cloud only from *inside* a running session (Cursor's and Mistral's `&`
 * prefix, Gemini's `/jules`, Copilot's `/delegate`) or have no cloud at all;
 * those need no tab of their own and are left out. Checked 2026-09-26 against
 * the installed `--help` (Claude 2.1.283, Copilot 1.0.88) and the vendors'
 * docs (Codex `codex cloud`, Kiro `--cloud`, Mistral `vibe --remote`).
 *
 * Two actions:
 *   - `new`  starts a cloud session. Some CLIs take the task on the command
 *            line and need it up front (`needsTask`).
 *   - `open` picks an existing one (Claude's `--teleport` pulls it into this
 *            terminal; Copilot's `--connect` attaches; Codex's `cloud` TUI lists
 *            and starts tasks).
 *
 * A cloud tab is deliberately **not** resumable: restore rebuilds an agent's
 * args from `RESUMABLE_AGENTS` (a `--resume` of a *local* session), which a
 * cloud tab never had, and re-running its launch args would start a second
 * cloud session. The session itself lives on with the vendor either way.
