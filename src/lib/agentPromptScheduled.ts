/**
 * Which collected prompts already went to scheduling.
 *
 * The two actions on a collected prompt part ways at send time: "Send now"
 * retires the prompt to the history (`sendCollectedPrompt`), so the list itself
 * says what happened to it, while "Schedule…" leaves it sitting exactly where
 * it was — the rule is somewhere else, on a tab, behind a dialog. The list then
 * reads the same whether a prompt is idle text or is going out at 09:00 every
 * morning, which is how the same prompt gets scheduled twice.
 *
 * The link is the prompt's TEXT, not an id: a schedule stores
 * `normalizedScheduleMessage(message)`, so the sanitized message is a key both
 * sides already agree on, with no field to add to the stored schedule and
 * nothing to keep in step. It follows the truth rather than an intention —
 * delete the rule and the mark goes with it, reword either side and the mark
 * drops, which is the honest answer to "is this text scheduled".
 *
 * Pure over already-loaded schedules, like `lib/agentPromptFilter`: the view
 * holds the tabs and their rules, this decides what they mean for the list.
