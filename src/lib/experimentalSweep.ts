/**
 * Withdrawing an experiment that owns a tab.
 *
 * `lib/experimental` decides *whether* a feature is live; this decides what
 * happens to what is already on screen when the answer changes to no. Only the
 * flags in `EXPERIMENTAL_TAB_KINDS` have anything to withdraw — mail and the
 * browser, the app's two network clients — and for them "off" has to mean the
 * tab is gone, not merely that the menu entry is. A switch that leaves a mail
 * client running is not a switch.
 *
 * Three surfaces, one rule:
 *
 *  - **Open tabs** in every loaded scope → `closeTabsOfKinds`.
 *  - **Live browser windows** → closed too. They are separate OS windows the
 *    browser feature owns; a hardened webview left running after the browser was
 *    switched off is precisely the thing the switch is for. (They have their own
 *    `browser_live_pages` opt-in on top of this one; that gate says whether they
 *    may be *opened*, which does nothing about one already up.)
 *  - **Restored tabs**, handled elsewhere: `stores/tabs`'s `loadFromLayout` drops
 *    them as the layout is read, so a scope restored after this ran does not
 *    bring them back and the two halves never race.
 *
 * A popout window is a separate React root with its own tabs store, so it sweeps
 * itself (`DetachedApp`) and this deliberately leaves its tabs alone — see
 * `closeTabsOfKinds`.
 *
 * Installed once per window at startup (`AppShell`), and re-run on every settings
 * change: the flag can go off from the Settings panel, from Debug mode being
 * turned off (unset flags follow it), or from settings simply arriving late.
 * Running it repeatedly is free — after the first pass there is nothing to close.
