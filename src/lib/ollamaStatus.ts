/**
 * **The** poll of Ollama's `stopped | idle | loaded` state — one timer for the
 * whole app, however many components ask.
 *
 * `ollama_status` is a `GET /api/ps` round trip, and it had two independent
 * callers on 5 s timers: the header's 🧠 `LocalModelMenu` lamp, and
 * `useLocalModelLoaded` in the file viewer — the second of which is **per
 * editable viewer tab**, so the request rate grew with the number of open tabs
 * rather than staying a property of the app. The observable result was a steady
 * stream of paired `/api/ps` hits a couple of seconds apart, forever, asking the
 * same question and getting the same answer.
 *
 * The state is genuinely global — whether a model is resident in Ollama's memory
 * is a fact about the machine, not about a tab — so a single shared poller is not
 * just cheaper, it is the more correct model: every surface now flips on the same
 * observation instead of each discovering it up to 5 s apart.
 *
 * Shape: subscribers register an interval they'd be happy with, the timer runs at
 * the **shortest** one asked for, and it only exists while at least one component
 * is subscribed. A tick that lands while a request is still in flight is skipped
 * rather than queued, so a slow or wedged Ollama can never accumulate a backlog.
