/**
 * A stable colour per project box. Every place a box appears — its pill in the
 * row's leading segment, the swatch on each member's project pill, the rows of
 * the chip's dropdown and of a pill's Boxes menu — wears the same colour, so a
 * box is recognised by colour before it is read by name, and a member pill's
 * swatch answers "which box" without a tooltip.
 *
 * Hashed from the box's **id**, not its name: renaming a box must not recolour
 * it (the colour is what the eye has learned), and two boxes with the same
 * name still tell apart. Same hue/saturation/lightness recipe as
 * `categoryColor`, so box colours and category colours sit in one family and
 * stay legible on both light and dark headers.
 *
 * A colour the user picked (the box pill menu's Colour row) wins over the
 * hash. It is stored on the box as a `#rrggbb` string and validated here, at
 * the one place it turns into CSS: anything else in `boxes.json` (a hand edit,
 * a newer build's shape) reads as "no colour" and falls back to the hash,
 * never as a CSS value to render.
