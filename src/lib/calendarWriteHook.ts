/**
 * The seam between a calendar edit and CalDAV push (`docs/caldav_plan.md`
 * Phase 3) — one registered handler, and nothing else.
 *
 * It exists to keep the dependency pointing one way. `stores/caldav` already
 * imports `stores/calendar` (a sync writes what the calendar surfaces read), so
 * having the calendar store import the CalDAV store back would be a cycle
 * between two module-scope `create()` calls — the shape that resolves to
 * `undefined` at import time depending on which file the bundler reaches first.
 * Instead the calendar store depends on *this*, which knows nothing, and the
 * CalDAV side registers itself at mount. `initMachineSync` installs a
 * subscription in `AppShell` for the same reason.
 *
 * **The two directions are not symmetric, and that is the point.**
 *
 * - An **upsert** is announced *after* the local write succeeded. `calendar.json`
 *   is the user's own store and must not be held hostage to a server being
 *   reachable: an edit made offline is still an edit, and it pushes on the next
 *   sync.
 * - A **delete** is announced *before*, and a rejection **stops** it. The other
 *   order deletes the row locally and then discovers the server refused, leaving
 *   nothing to retry from and an appointment that is gone here and still there
 *   for everyone else.
