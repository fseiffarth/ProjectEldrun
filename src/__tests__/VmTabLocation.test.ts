/**
 * VM tier (`docs/vm_projects_plan.md`) — the frontend half of the
 * no-local-fallback rule: a VM project's tab locality is PINNED to the VM
 * host. The agents-default-local rule (right for network remotes: WAN
 * latency, offline work, login nodes) is precisely the escape the VM tier
 * forbids — an agent "running local" is the untrusted code stepping outside
 * the boundary. The backend's spawn guard refuses the spawn as the hard
 * boundary; `effectiveTabLocation`'s `vmProject` pin is what keeps the
 * frontend from ever building one.
