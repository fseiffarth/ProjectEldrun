/**
 * The Skills Library's **install target** (`docs/skills_plan.md`) — the one
 * thing about the feature that is scoped at all, since the sources and their
 * cached clones are machine state shared by every project.
 *
 * What is pinned down here is the boundary rather than the plumbing. The
 * personal scope (`~/.claude/skills/`, read by every project on this machine
 * and, since it is also loaded by *uncontained* sessions, the widest-reaching
 * destination in the app) is addressed by a variant that carries **no path**:
 * the backend resolves it against its own home. If this side ever grew a way to
 * spell the personal scope as a project directory — a home path threaded into
 * `{ kind: "project" }` — the split would be decoration, so the tests below
 * assert on the *shape* that crosses the IPC boundary and not merely on the
 * command name.
