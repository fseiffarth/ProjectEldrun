/**
 * The display rule for end-to-end signatures (`docs/mail_encryption_plan.md`
 * §4), asserted on the frontend side of the boundary.
 *
 * The rule itself lives in Rust and is tested there; what this file pins is the
 * *rendering* half — that no state but `verified` ever gets positive chrome, and
 * that a message the reader cannot read is never toned as though everything is
 * fine. Both are one-line functions, which is exactly why they need a test: a
 * one-line function is the kind that gets "simplified" into saying something
 * else.
