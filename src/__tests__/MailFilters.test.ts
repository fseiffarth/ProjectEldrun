/**
 * The pure half of the mail filter dialog.
 *
 * What is deliberately **not** tested here is whether a rule matches a message:
 * that lives in Rust (`services::mail_filters`) and has its own suite, and a
 * TypeScript copy of it would be the second implementation of the one thing the
 * feature must not be ambiguous about. What *is* tested is everything a user can
 * do to a rule before it gets there — because each of these has a failure mode
 * that produces a rule which saves cleanly and then never fires.
