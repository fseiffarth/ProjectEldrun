/**
 * The container's **scope** (#38): which of a project's tabs actually run inside
 * it — everything, or agent tabs only.
 *
 * The rule lives in the backend (`services::sandbox::resolve_spawn_authority`,
 * which re-derives it from the trusted project record and is the authority). What
 * is tested here is the renderer's *copy* of it in `CenterPanel`, which exists for
 * two things the backend cannot do: the flag is one of `TerminalView`'s spawn
 * dependencies, so it is what respawns a live shell when the scope changes — a
 * frontend that ignored `scope` would leave that shell running inside the
 * container indefinitely — and it keeps the renderer from claiming a container the
 * backend is about to take away, which would otherwise log an authority downgrade
 * on every ordinary shell spawn.
 *
 * The derivation is inlined in `CenterPanel`'s pane map, so it is restated here
 * rather than imported. That is a real duplication, and it is why the last test
 * pins the *shape* of the expression: if the component's version gains a term,
 * this file must be updated deliberately rather than silently passing.
