/**
 * The frontend half of the hostile-message end-to-end check.
 *
 * `src-tauri/tests/mail_hostile_message.rs` drives one message carrying ~40
 * payloads through `parse_message` → `sanitize_message_html` and writes the
 * result to `fixtures/hostile_sanitized_body.html`. A Rust test asserts that
 * file is byte-identical to what the pipeline produces today, so what is
 * checked here is the **real** backend output rather than a hand-written
 * approximation that could drift into being easier than the real thing.
 *
 * What this file adds is the last leg: that same output going through the
 * render path — the tripwire that guards it, and the srcdoc it lands in.
 *
 * Regenerate the fixture with:
 *   UPDATE_HOSTILE_FIXTURE=1 cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml \
 *     --test mail_hostile_message

 * **A known residue, characterized rather than asserted as desirable.**

 * from the *link table's* display text (`anchor_text_at` → `is_format_char`),
 * which is what the link-confirm dialog reads. They are **not** stripped from
 * the message body, so an anchor's visible text inside the frame can still
 * reorder itself — `bank.example<RLO>gnp.exe` reads as `bank.exampleexe.png`.
 *
 * It is inert (no href, so the body text is not clickable at all) and the
 * decision surface — the links panel and its confirm dialog — is clean. What it
 * can do is make body prose lie about itself. If body-side stripping is added
 * later, this test is the place that says what changed.
