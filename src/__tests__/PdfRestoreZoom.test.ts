/**
 * Reopening a PDF (#viewerpos): which saved zoom is a zoom, and which is just the
 * fit of a pane that no longer exists.
 *
 * The viewer persists its scale on every change, so a saved `scale` is usually
 * the fit-to-width value the last pane's width produced — not something the
 * reader chose. Restoring one of those as an absolute zoom is how a PDF came back
 * badly rescaled after a restart, and, because it also cleared the fit baseline,
 * the resize re-fit that would have corrected it stayed off for the session.
 * `pdfFitted` is the evidence that separates the two cases; these tests lock the
 * rule and the scroll-target rescaling that follows a re-fit.
