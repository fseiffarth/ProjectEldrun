 * finished unseen (green, solid) or waiting on a decision (amber) — nothing
 * animated, the tab ring's own vocabulary (`--status-*`).
 *
 * Each bar is a **button that opens its own tab** — the strip already knows
 * which tab it is drawing (`statusTabsByScope`), and "an agent over there wants
 * something" is a statement whose only useful next step is going there; without
 * the click that meant switching project and then hunting the tab bar for the
 * one that was glowing. Hence the bars are also sized to be hit: a 3px sliver is
 * a readable signal but not a target.
 *
 * A *component* rather than a snippet each pill repeats, because the root
 * terminal is a scope like any other: its tabs run the same agents, and a pill
 * that showed nothing while an agent worked in it could only be read as "nothing
 * is running there". One component is what keeps the surfaces from drifting into
 * two different answers to the same question — the scope chip, which stands for
 * root, Trash and every box at once, is the other one, via
 * `ScopeSetStatusBars`.
 *
 * The SELECTED scope keeps its bars: the strip is a tally of what the scope is
 * doing, not a list of what still needs a glance, and the scope you are in is
 * the one whose agents you most need to see running. Only "finished unseen" is
 * inherently about unread output, and it can't arise for a tab on screen.
 *
 * Positioned absolutely, so the host must be a positioned box (`.project-pill`
 * and `.box-chip` both are).
