/**
 * **The one "Save password" row** — the switch, the hint that says what it will
 * actually do, and the disclosure for the case where it cannot do anything.
 *
 * There were three near-identical copies (Connect modal, new/extend-project
 * section, add-a-machine form) and they had already drifted on the thing that
 * matters most:
 *
 *  - **Disabled during a terminal sign-in.** A terminal login never calls
 *    `ssh_connect`, so it never carries `remember` — the toggle has nothing to
 *    act through. Two surfaces disabled it and said so; two left it live, so the
 *    user ticked Save and nothing was ever saved. It is disabled, not hidden: a
 *    saved password belongs to the *host*, not to how you signed in this time,
 *    and a row that vanishes reads as one that was discarded.
 *  - **"Not saved" vs "we can't tell".** The row renders a `SavedCredential`
 *    tri-state (`useSavedCredential`), so a locked keyring produces a banner with
 *    an **Unlock keyring** button — the treatment the VPN modal has had all along
 *    — instead of a confidently-empty toggle that invites the user to untick a
 *    credential that is actually there.
 *  - **What the backend did.** `saveError` is `SshConnectOutcome.save_error`
 *    verbatim ("the OS keyring is locked, so nothing was saved…"), shown inline,
 *    because a ticked box with an empty keychain behind it is exactly the state
 *    that surfaces at the *next* launch as an unexplained password prompt.
 *
 * Unticking is handled by the caller (it owns the target and the forget call);
 * this only reports the state and hands back the new checked value.
