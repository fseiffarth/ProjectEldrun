/**
 * **"Is a password saved for this host?" — asked so the answer can be _"we don't
 * know"_.**
 *
 * Five surfaces used to ask this the same wrong way: `remote_has_saved_password`,
 * `.catch(() => false)`, one boolean. That boolean then drove the "Save password"
 * pre-tick — and an unticked box is not a neutral state, it is an instruction:
 * `ssh_connect`'s `remember: false` means *clear the saved credential*. So an
 * unreadable keychain (locked Secret Service — which answers every lookup exactly
 * like an empty one) unticked the box, and the next successful connect deleted the
 * very password it had just authenticated with. That is not hypothetical: it is
 * how the user's most-used host lost its credential.
 *
 * This hook is the one implementation, and it fixes the three things that made
 * that possible:
 *
 *  1. **A tri-state**, not a boolean — `saved` / `notSaved` / `unreadable`, plus
 *     `checking` while the read is in flight. "Unknown" never masquerades as
 *     "nothing saved" again, which is what lets the UI say so (and offer the
 *     unlock) instead of quietly proposing a delete.
 *  2. **A bounded read.** The backing keychain call is a D-Bus round trip that
 *     blocks *indefinitely* against a locked collection, so the read is raced
 *     against a 4 s timer (the pattern `VpnIndicator` established) and a timeout
 *     lands on `unreadable` — the state with an action behind it — never on a
 *     confident `notSaved`.
 *  3. **`applyOutcome`.** What is saved is what the *backend did*
 *     (`SshConnectOutcome`), never what the request asked for: a locked keyring
 *     refuses the write and reports why, and the row has to show that rather than
 *     a ticked box with an empty keychain behind it.
 *
 * `forget()` is the only path that deletes. Clearing a credential is an explicit
 * act by the user, never a side effect of connecting — see `rememberArg`.

 * per character against a service that is slow while its daemon starts and
 * blocks outright while the collection is locked. Typing `user@host.example`
 * fired eighteen of those, seventeen of them about hosts that were only ever
 * prefixes of the real one.
 *
 * Short enough to feel immediate once typing stops, long enough that a name is

 * **The value a connect may send as `remember` — `true` or `null`, never `false`.**

 * successful connect carrying `false` destroys the password it authenticated
 * with. So an unticked box means **leave the keychain alone** (`null`), and
 * deleting is left to the explicit forget the untick handler already calls.
 *
 * The same rule covers `checking` and `unreadable` for free: the pre-tick is
 * seeded from the resolved state, so a box that has not been (or cannot be)
 * resolved is unticked, and an unticked box sends `null`. A box the user ticked
 * *themselves* still sends `true` even on an unreadable keyring — that is a
 * request to save, and the backend answers it with `save_error` if it can't.
 *
 * The pattern is `stores/globalMachines`' (`opts.remember ? true : null`); this
 * is that decision named, so no fourth copy has to rediscover it.
