/**
 * Placeholder shown in a remote (SSH) project's REMOTE pane while its pooled
 * connection is down. Mounting the real terminal/SFTP view here would spawn
 * `ssh -tt` against a dead pool and freeze the window, so the pane is held until
 * the project connects (then it re-renders and the live view takes over). Local
 * panes and the file browser are NOT held — they work on the mirror offline.
 *
 * Shared by both the remote terminal pane (CenterPanel) and the remote file
 * viewer (FileViewerPane, for a remote-native file), so a disconnected remote
 * shows ONE unified "Not connected" card instead of each viewer flashing its own
 * red read error.
