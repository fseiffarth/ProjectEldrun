/**
 * The single open-a-LaTeX-file policy: open (or focus) the ONE "TeX workspace"
 * tab for the document `clickedPath` belongs to, and center it on `clickedPath`.
 *
 * The GOAL is "one tab, not a scatter": every place that used to open a `.tex`
 * as its own embed tab (the FileTree double-click, a drag-to-tab, Quick Open)
 * funnels through here instead. It resolves the build root (`resolve_tex_root`,
 * so a child `\input` file redirects to its main document) and dedupes on that
 * root, so there is exactly one workspace tab per main document. Opening a child
 * of an already-open workspace just focuses it and switches the center via
 * `texActivePath` — no second tab.
 *
 * Kept in this tiny module (imports only the tabs store, `resolveTexRoot` and
 * `paths`) rather than in the 7,000-line `FileViewerPane`, mirroring how
 * `openProjectFilesTab` is split out, so every call site can import it without
 * dragging the whole viewer graph (and its import cycles) along.
 *
 * `place` is the detached-popout / drop-target seam (like `openFileEntry`'s
 * `placeTab`): when given AND no existing workspace is found, it is handed the
 * fresh tab payload to place (into a popout, a split, a drop slot) instead of the
 * default `addTab` into the focused subwindow.
 *
 * `drop` marks a DROP rather than a click, for the existing-workspace case. A
 * workspace is a single-tab concept, so an already-open one is never duplicated —
 * but a drop names a destination, and "focus it wherever it already is" is not
 * an answer to "put it here": a `.tex` dragged from the side panel onto a popout
 * while its workspace was open in the main window lit the popout's split preview
 * and then visibly did nothing (the existing tab was focused in the main window,
 * or — when it lived in a popout, where `setActive` cannot see it — nowhere at
 * all). So a drop of the document's ROOT hands the existing tab to
 * `drop.relocate` to be MOVED to the target; a drop of a CHILD (a file the root
 * `\input`s, which the build-root resolver folds into the same document) opens
 * that child as its own editor tab at the target through `place`, leaving the
 * workspace where it is — the user dragged a distinct file to a specific place,
 * and moving the whole document there, or nothing at all, is not what a drop
 * of that file asked for. A plain open (a click, no destination) still focuses
 * the workspace in place and centers it on the clicked file.

/**
 * Route a SyncTeX reverse-search target (a `.tex` source) into an ALREADY-OPEN
 * workspace, when one owns it. Resolves the build root and looks for an existing
 * workspace tab keyed on it; if found, focuses that tab and switches its center
 * to `sourcePath` (via `texActivePath`), returning `true`. Returns `false` — and
 * touches nothing — when no workspace tab is open for the document, so the caller
 * falls back to the standalone open.
 *
 * The deliberate difference from `openTexWorkspace` is that this NEVER creates a
 * tab: reverse search is a navigation into an existing surface, so a PDF whose
 * workspace the user has closed should reopen the source the ordinary way, not
 * resurrect the whole workspace.
 *
 * #42 cross-window, in escalation order:
 *  1. A workspace MOUNTED IN THIS WINDOW is centered through the `texCenter`
 *     registry — the only probe that works in a popout (whose tabs store holds
 *     no tabs), and in the main window it also routes through the workspace's
 *     own `goTo`, so the back stack records the step.
 *  2. A workspace tab in this window's store that is DETACHED (rendered in a
 *     popout) gets the switch broadcast to the window that renders it: a
 *     `setViewerState` here would write a field the popout's one-time-seeded
 *     local mirror never re-reads — the write that used to make pdf→tex sync
 *     look dead for a popped-out workspace.
 *  3. An in-layout tab keeps the direct store write.
