/**
 * The remarks panel (#pdf-notes) — every comment in the document in one list, and the
 * way to walk them.
 *
 * The markers on the page answer "is there a comment here?"; they cannot answer "what
 * did anyone say about this paper?", because the answer is spread over forty sheets
 * and each marker holds its text behind a click. That is what this pane is for: it is
 * the *reading* surface, so a row carries the whole remark rather than a preview, and
 * the page is where the remark sits rather than where it is read.
 *
 * Three decisions.
 *
 * **Next/Previous walk a ring**, and the row that is current is the one the walk is
 * parked on — reaching the last remark and pressing Next again brings you back to the
 * first, which is how a reader checks they have been through all of them. The order
 * is the document's own reading order (`placedNotes`), never the annotation array's.
 *
 * **A row goes to the remark; it does not open it.** Clicking scrolls the page to the
 * marker and flashes it, because the text is already here — opening the card as well
 * would put a focused textarea over the page for somebody who only wanted to see
 * where the comment was. ✎ is the separate, deliberate act of editing one.
 *
 * **Autosave is stated, not assumed.** The switch lives here rather than in the
 * toolbar because this is where remarks are worked on, and the line under it says
 * exactly what the guarantee is worth: remarks are written on their own, but a page
 * move or a blackout is never carried along by one. That asymmetry is the whole
 * safety of the feature (see `pageModel`'s `isPristineExceptNotes`) and it is not
 * something a reader could otherwise find out.
