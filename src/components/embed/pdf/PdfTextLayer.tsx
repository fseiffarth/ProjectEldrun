/**
 * Selectable text over a rendered page (#pdf-textselect).
 *
 * The reader paints pages to a canvas, and a canvas has no text in it: until this
 * layer existed the only way to get a sentence out of a PDF was to retype it, or to
 * copy the *region* as an image (the ✂ tool next door, which is a picture of the
 * words rather than the words). What sits here is pdf.js's own {@link TextLayer} —
 * one transparent, correctly-placed span per text run — so the browser's ordinary
 * selection lands on the glyphs the reader sees and Ctrl+C copies what the file
 * actually says.
 *
 * Three things are worth saying about it.
 *
 * **It is not a mode.** It was, briefly, and that was wrong: selecting words in a
 * document is what a pointer over text does everywhere else, and a reader who has to
 * find and arm a tool first will simply retype the sentence. What made it a mode is
 * that the layer takes the pointer over the whole sheet — so the answer is the one
 * pdf.js's own viewer uses: everything that needs its own click (the link boxes, the
 * search hits, the markers, the highlights, the blackout and region-copy surfaces) is
 * stacked ABOVE it by z-index, which leaves the plain drag — the one gesture nothing
 * else wants — to the text. The stack is in `themes.css`, and it is load-bearing: drop
 * a `z-index` from one of those layers and it silently stops being clickable.
 *
 * **Only near pages build one.** Same gate as the canvas render and the annotation
 * reads: `getTextContent` on a 300-page document is the whole file's text, and a
 * selection cannot start on a sheet that is nowhere near the viewport. That gate is
 * what makes always-on affordable at all — the cost is one text read per page the
 * reader actually scrolls to, which is what Ctrl+F already pays.
 *
 * **Zoom costs nothing.** pdf.js lays the spans out in the page's own units and
 * multiplies by `--scale-factor` in CSS, so a zoom is one custom property away and
 * the text content is never re-read. That is the same bargain the link boxes and the
 * search hits strike by storing big points and multiplying at render.
