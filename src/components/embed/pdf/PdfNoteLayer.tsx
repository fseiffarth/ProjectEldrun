/**
 * Remarks on a page (#pdf-notes) — the markers, the highlights, the right-click menu
 * that places one, and the little card a remark is written in.
 *
 * The gesture is the one every other PDF reader has: **right-click the page, add a
 * remark**, or **select some words and mark them** (`PdfSelectionBar`, whose creations
 * land here as ordinary remarks). There is no tool to arm and no mode to leave, which
 * is why remarks are unlike the blackout tool next door — a blackout is a destructive
 * edit and wants a mode you can see you are in, a comment is a thing you do in the
 * middle of reading.
 *
 * A remark is drawn as one of two things and the model says which (`quads`): a
 * **sticky note** is a pin at a point, a **highlight** is the boxes it covers. That is
 * the only branch in this file, and everything else — the card, the menu, the
 * dismissal rule, the flash the panel walks by — is written once for both, which is
 * the whole reason the two are one model. What the branch does change is real: a
 * highlight has no drag (it is pinned to words, not placed at a point), it has a
 * colour worth changing, its card opens *under* the sentence rather than beside a pin,
 * and clearing its text does not delete it.
 *
 * Purely presentational: every piece of state (which menu is open, which remark is
 * being written) belongs to the page canvas, so the *page* stays the single owner of
 * "what is going on over this sheet" and two overlapping affordances cannot both
 * think they have the pointer.
 *
 * Three rules are this layer's own.
 *
 * A marker is drawn at a **fixed size**, not scaled with the page. It stands for a
 * remark rather than covering an area of the document, so at 400% it should still be
 * a pin and not a poster — the same reason a PDF's own `NoZoom` flag exists.
 *
 * The card **stages the text and commits once**. Every keystroke going through the
 * arrangement would make each letter its own undo step; instead Save (or **Enter**,
 * with Shift+Enter left as the new line) writes one edit, and Escape discards a draft
 * that was never in the file.
 *
 * A press **anywhere else puts the card away**, exactly as the menu beside it is
 * dismissed — the card is a popover over a document being read, and a reader who has
 * clicked back onto the page has finished with it. What it does with the draft is the
 * decided half: a card whose text differs from the file's is **committed** rather than
 * dropped, because a stray click must not cost a sentence and Escape is still there
 * for "never mind"; a card that was merely opened and read only closes, since a commit
 * writes a fresh `modified` stamp and marks the sheet edited, and looking at a remark
 * is not editing one.
 *
 * An **empty remark is not a remark**: saving one with nothing in it deletes it, and a
 * new one that was never typed into is simply dropped. A blank comment marker is
 * indistinguishable from a bug in whatever viewer opens the file next.
 *
 * A marker also **drags to a new spot**, which is the fourth rule and the one that
 * costs something: a right-click places a remark exactly where the pointer was, and
 * where the pointer was is regularly a line off — so without a move, correcting one
 * means deleting the remark and retyping it. The gesture has to share the marker with
 * the click that opens the card, so it is distance that tells them apart
 * ({@link NOTE_DRAG_SLOP}, measured in CSS pixels so it means the same at 40% and at
 * 400%), and the click is swallowed only when the pointer actually travelled. Pointer
 * events with the capture taken on the marker itself, and `pointercancel` treated as
 * an ordinary end, because on this engine a gesture can finish with either.
