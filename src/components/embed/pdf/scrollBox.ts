/**
 * Scrolling the PDF reader to a spot on a page — inside the PDF's own scroll box
 * and NOWHERE else.
 *
 * `Element.scrollIntoView` is the obvious way to do this and the wrong one here:
 * it walks up and scrolls EVERY scrollable ancestor, and an `overflow: hidden`
 * box counts as one. The PDF pane sits inside several (`.file-viewer` itself,
 * and the tab host above it), which scroll perfectly well programmatically and
 * then show no scrollbar to scroll back with — so a SyncTeX jump that had to
 * move the view at all pushed the toolbar, the page, and the pane's own chrome
 * off their container and left them there, with the fit-to-width page no longer
 * centred in a pane that was itself displaced. Nothing short of a resize or a
 * re-render put it back.
 *
 * So: address the scroller directly, and move only what has to move — the
 * vertical axis, plus a horizontal nudge only when the target is genuinely out
 * of view (what `inline: "nearest"` is for, and what a zoomed-in page still
 * needs). At fit-to-width there is no horizontal overflow, so `scrollLeft`
 * stays where it is and the page stays centred.
