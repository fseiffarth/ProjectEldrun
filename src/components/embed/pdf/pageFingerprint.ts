/**
 * A cheap, content-derived fingerprint of one rendered PDF page.
 *
 * A LaTeX recompile rewrites the WHOLE output file even when one sentence
 * changed, so the viewer's reload had no way to tell "page 7 is different" from
 * "page 7 is byte-identical to what is already painted" — it simply repainted
 * every page on screen. Repainting is what the reader sees as the flash on every
 * build, and on a long document it is also seconds of rasterisation for pages
 * that end up pixel-identical.
 *
 * The fingerprint is taken from the page's OPERATOR LIST — the drawing
 * instructions pdf.js would execute to paint it — not from its extracted text.
 * Text alone would miss a redrawn figure, a moved rule, or a changed font; the
 * operator list is the actual paint program, so anything that would change a
 * pixel changes it too. The one thing it does not reach through is raster image
 * DATA (an image is referenced by object id and painted by `paintImageXObject`),
 * so a figure replaced by a different bitmap of identical size, drawn at an
 * identical position, can fingerprint the same. That is the deliberate limit of
 * this optimisation, and why {@link samePage} is only ever used to skip a
 * repaint of an ALREADY-PAINTED page — never to skip a first paint, and never to
 * decide anything the reader cannot fix with a zoom or a reopen.
 *
 * Cost: `getOperatorList()` is the parse half of rendering, which the render
 * would have done anyway; what a match saves is the rasterisation, the canvas
 * churn, and the flash. It runs only for pages near the viewport (the same ones
 * that would have been repainted).
