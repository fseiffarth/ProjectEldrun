/**
 * What the reader has selected on a page, as geometry this viewer can act on
 * (#pdf-textselect).
 *
 * Selecting text in a PDF is the browser's own job here — the text layer puts a
 * transparent, correctly-placed span over every run of glyphs, and from there an
 * ordinary drag, a double-click on a word and Ctrl+A are the engine's. What this
 * module adds is the translation back: a DOM `Range` is a set of client rectangles on
 * screen, and everything downstream of a selection in this viewer (a highlight
 * annotation, the boxes it is drawn as, the `/QuadPoints` it is saved as) is measured
 * in **big points from a page's top-left**, the space the blackout marks, the search
 * hits and the link boxes already live in.
 *
 * Three things about it are decisions rather than mechanics.
 *
 * **A selection is read per page, not per document.** A drag that crosses a page break
 * is one selection to the browser and two annotations to a PDF, because an annotation
 * belongs to a page. So the rects are sorted into the page wrappers they land in and
 * clipped to them, which makes the cross-page case fall out of the same code as the
 * ordinary one rather than being a case nobody tested.
 *
 * **Line rects are merged, and only along a line.** `Range.getClientRects()` hands
 * back one rectangle per *text node fragment*, so a sentence that crosses a font
 * change, a `\emph` or a ligature run arrives as four or five boxes on the same line —
 * which as `/QuadPoints` would be four or five overlapping quads, drawn on top of one
 * another and, at 40% opacity each, several shades darker at every seam. Merging by
 * line fixes both the appearance and the annotation. Merging *across* lines is
 * deliberately not done: a highlight's quads are per line by definition, and a box
 * spanning two of them would paint the margin between them.
 *
 * **Nothing here reads the page's text content.** The words come out of the DOM
 * selection the reader made, which is the same string Ctrl+C would put on the
 * clipboard — so what a highlight quotes and what a copy produces cannot disagree.
