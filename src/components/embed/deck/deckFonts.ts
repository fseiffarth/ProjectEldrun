/**
 * Loading a deck's **embedded fonts** (TODO V #120).
 *
 * The one rule this file exists to keep is the one `deck/fonts.ts` is built on:
 * **the face that is measured must be the face that is drawn, and the face that
 * is drawn must be the face that is embedded.** Three consumers, one source of
 * bytes:
 *
 *  - `metrics.register(path, bytes)` — line breaking, on the stage and in the
 *    exporter;
 *  - an `@font-face` installed into the document — what the DOM renderer paints;
 *  - `exportDeck({ fonts })` — what pdf-lib embeds.
 *
 * Splitting those across three loaders is precisely how an export silently
 * reflows, which is the failure the shared-metrics design was created to prevent.
 * So there is one hook, it hands the same `Map` to all three, and a font it
 * could not read is reported as *missing* rather than quietly substituted in one
 * place and not another.
 *
 * Lives beside `deckAssets.ts` for the same reason that file exists: the audience
 * window is a separate webview with its own heap and its own `document`, so it
 * must install its own `@font-face` rules rather than be handed the editor's.
