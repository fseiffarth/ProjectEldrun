/**
 * The BibTeX (`.bib`) **card view** — one card per bibliography entry, each a
 * list of its `field = {value}` pairs, in one long scrolling column.
 *
 * The shape is the YAML/JSON card view's, minus its drill navigation, because a
 * `.bib` is not a nested document: it is a *flat list of records*, all at one
 * level, so there is nothing to drill into and the reader wants the whole list at
 * once. What a flat list of a few thousand records needs instead is a **filter**
 * (over the key, the type and every field value) and a per-card **fold**, and the
 * fold rides with the tab like the tree's collapse state.
 *
 * Like the tree and the table it renders controls but EDITS THE TEXT: every
 * action splices the draft via `lib/viewers/bib`'s ops, so a card edit is an
 * ordinary dirty/undoable/saveable change on the same draft Source shows and
 * Ctrl+S writes — and the file's field order, brace-protected capitalization,
 * `"…"` quoting, indentation and `%` comments survive it untouched.
 *
 * Two honesty rules it inherits: a value it cannot safely rewrite (a `#`
 * concatenation, a `@string` macro reference) is **shown, not offered**, and text
 * belonging to no record is **admitted in a note** rather than silently omitted —
 * a card view that quietly hides part of a file is worse than no card view.
 *
 * Reading a list of a few thousand records needs three more things, and all three
 * are **display-only** — none of them rewrites the file, whose hand-sorted order
 * is somebody's own work:
 *
 *  - a **venue** picker (which conference/journal), because "what did we publish
 *    at this conference" is a question a text filter answers badly: `neurips`
 *    also matches every entry whose abstract mentions it;
 *  - a **sort** (file order · first author · year, either direction), persisted
 *    with the tab like the fold, since it hides nothing;
 *  - and **lazy rendering**: a card is a dozen inputs and a growing textarea per
 *    field, so a 2000-entry library was ~30k live DOM nodes to open a file with.
 *    Only a window of the list is mounted, extended as the reader scrolls (see
 *    {@link BIB_PAGE}).
