/**
 * The header's calendar button — the twin of `MailIndicator`, and built the same
 * way for the same reason: a calendar tab belongs to a scope and is left behind
 * by a project switch, while your calendar is not a property of the project you
 * happen to be looking at. One button in the header, always in the same place,
 * opening the same `CalendarPane` as an overlay (`CalendarOverlayHost`).
 *
 * Off by default (`calendar_global_app`), with **no experimental gate above it**
 * — unlike mail, the calendar is shipped and its store reads one local file, so
 * there is nothing to withdraw and nothing to keep off the network.
 *
 * **The badge is derived, not acknowledged**, which is the one real difference
 * from the mail badge and is `eventsLeftToday`'s doc in one line: mail counts
 * arrivals and clears when you open it, because a delivery has then been seen;
 * an appointment does not stop being at 3 p.m. because you looked at it. So this
 * number is recomputed — from the store on every edit, and from the clock every
 * minute — and reaches zero on its own at the end of the day.
 *
 * **Hovering the button reads out today and tomorrow**, the hover shape its
 * header siblings already have (`MailIndicator`, `LocalModelMenu`,
 * `VpnIndicator`): the badge can only ever say *how many* are left, and "2" is
 * precisely the number that sends someone opening the whole calendar to find out
 * whether one of them is in five minutes. Tomorrow is there because by late
 * afternoon that is the question — and as its own **section below** today, never
 * merged into one list, where a 09:00 under a 16:00 reads as an ordering bug.
 * Affordable on hover for `MailIndicator`'s reason — the store is already in
 * memory and one local file behind it, so a pointer crossing the header touches
 * no network and starts no work. Past occurrences are **dimmed, not hidden**,
 * which is the agenda rail's rule and what stops this list from disagreeing with
 * the rail about what today held.
