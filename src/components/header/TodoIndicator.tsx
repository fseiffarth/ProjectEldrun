 * The header's ☑ button — `CalendarIndicator`'s twin, and badged the same way:
 * **derived, never acknowledged**.
 *
 * The number is what is *actionable today* — open cards, on a visible calendar,
 * due today or already overdue. Not "every open card": that is a figure in the
 * hundreds which never falls, and a badge that never falls is one the user learns
 * to ignore. Undated cards are excluded for the same reason — an undated card is
 * a someday, not something today demands.
 *
 * Because it is derived, it needs no dismissal: it drops as the day's cards are
 * ticked and rises again at midnight, which is also why the clock has to be
 * ticked separately (nothing in the store changes when a date rolls over).
 * Whether any of those cards is *overdue* is emphasis on the same badge, never a
 * second number to reconcile against the first.
 *
 * **Hovering reads the cards out** — the calendar button's hover shape, and
 * affordable for its reason: the tasks are already in memory behind one local
 * file, so a pointer crossing the header touches no network and starts no work.
 * Three sections, in the order the day asks about them: **Overdue**, **Today**,
 * **Tomorrow**. Overdue is separate because the badge's own emphasis has to be
 * explainable by something on screen, and tomorrow is separate because a date
 * that is not today, mixed into today's rows, reads as an ordering bug —
 * `CalendarIndicator`'s rule for the same list. Badge and list share ONE
 * selection (`urgentTodos`, which the badge's `todosDueCount` filters the same
 * way) and one `now`, since two `new Date()`s a few lines apart can straddle a
 * midnight, which is exactly the pairing where that would show.
 *
 * A row opens **its own card** (`openCard`), not just the board: a list that has
 * already named the card you want and then drops you at a board of forty is the
 * one place this could still cost a search.
