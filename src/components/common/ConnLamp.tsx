/**
 * A small red/orange/green status lamp for a remote connection channel.
 *  - off        → dim grey
 *  - connecting → orange
 *  - connected  → green
 *  - error      → red
 * Used both in the project dialog (next to the SSH / OpenVPN controls) and in
 * the header (the active remote project's live SSH / VPN state). Nothing here
 * animates: see the `--status-*` note in themes.css — a state told apart by an
 * animation is one you have to *watch* to read, and sixteen breathing lamps in
 * an open Machines menu were also the most expensive thing on screen.
 *
 * `busy` is a second, **orthogonal** axis, not a fifth state: a connected host
 * with live work on it (≥1 tmux session — see `stores/hostBusy`). It exists
 * because with a fleet held open all day "connected" is the resting state and
 * stops distinguishing anything, so the lamp answers "where am I actually
 * running something?" instead — as HOLLOW vs FILLED, the tab ring's
 * unfinished-vs-finished vocabulary applied to a dot: a machine that is merely
 * up is an outline, one with work on it is solid. Same green either way, so the
 * connection state it carries is never in doubt, and it never adds a lamp.
 *
 * Passing `busy` **at all** is what opts a lamp into that distinction, which is
 * why it is `boolean | undefined` rather than defaulting to false: a caller that
 * tracks no work axis (a VPN tunnel, a dialog's SSH channel) has nothing to say
 * about running-vs-up, and for it "connected" IS the whole story — so its lamp
 * stays solid rather than being demoted to an outline by a fact nobody measured.
 * The distinction is only honoured for `connected`; a hollow red or orange would
 * read as a state of the *connection*, which is what the colour already says.
