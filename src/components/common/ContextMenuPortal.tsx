/**
 * The one context-menu/popover portal. Every right-click menu and click-opened
 * popover that portals to <body> renders through this instead of hand-rolling
 * the pattern, because the hand-rolled copies drifted: no viewport clamping
 * (menus opened near an edge rendered off-screen), inconsistent z-indexes
 * (one sat *below* the modal backdrop), and catchers that missed the
 * second-right-click case (a native menu stacked on top of the open one).
 *
 * What it provides:
 * - a full-viewport dismiss catcher that closes on any pointer-down AND on a
 *   right-click (preventDefault, so no native menu stacks on top);
 * - Escape closes it, wherever focus is;
 * - viewport clamping via useClampToViewport — the same hook the in-flow
 *   siblings (FileTree, TabBar, PageStrip) use;
 * - class-level layering (`.context-menu-catcher` / `.context-menu-portal`,
 *   `--z-menu*` tokens in themes.css) — call sites pass NO z-index.
 *
 * `className` styles the menu chrome (default `context-menu`); the portal
 * always adds `context-menu-portal`, which owns position:fixed + z-index and
 * wins over a chrome class's own positioning (e.g. `.tab-new-menu`).
 *
 * `keepBelow` is for a menu dropped from a button rather than from the cursor
 * (the tab "+" menu): it stays put under its anchor instead of being shifted
 * up to fit — a tall one slid up lands ON the bar it dropped from and no longer
 * reads as belonging to that button — and is capped to the room below it, so
 * the overflow scrolls inside the menu (`.menu-scroll-region`) instead.
 *
 * `dismiss={false}` suspends both halves (no catcher, no Escape) for a stretch
 * where the menu must NOT close itself — while a dialog it opened is up and
 * owns the screen, and closing would take the pending answer with it.
