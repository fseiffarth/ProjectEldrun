/**
 * The confirmation every byte-sync transfer asks for, mounted once at the shell
 * like the HPC guard and the host-key prompt (a transfer can be started from the
 * file tree, the file view's toolbar, or the diverged-files list — in the main
 * window or in a popout — and they all ask through one dialog).
 *
 * What it is for: a pull writes the host's bytes over the mirror's and a push
 * writes the mirror's over the host's, so each is destructive to whichever side
 * is receiving. The old one-click buttons made the safe case (the other side has
 * nothing) and the lossy one (the other side has edits held nowhere else) look
 * identical. This states which one you are in — direction, scope, file count,
 * size, how much of it lands on top of something, and by name the files whose
 * content would be gone — and then gets out of the way.
 *
 * The numbers are the backend's read-only `sync_transfer_preview`. They may be
 * missing (still loading, failed, or a tree too big to inspect up front); the
 * dialog says so and keeps asking, because a preview is information and the
 * click is the gate.

/**
 * The dialog's headline sentence, indexed by direction × does-it-replace-anything
