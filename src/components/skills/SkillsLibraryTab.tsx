 * `scope` (so it works identically in a popout, which has no store-resolved
 * `projectDir` to hand it) and renders `SkillsLibraryView`, which owns
 * everything else.
 *
 * An unresolvable project is no longer an error state. It was, and it had to
 * be while a project was the only place a skill could land; now that the
 * personal scope exists the tab still has something to do — browse the catalog,
 * which is machine state, and install for every project on this machine — so it
 * hands the view a `null` project rather than a "no project selected" wall.
 * That is also what lets the tab exist at the root scope at all.
