 * The layout that should be RENDERED while a tab drag is in flight.
 *
 * When a subwindow's ONLY tab is being dragged, its (about-to-empty) subwindow is
 * pruned so the remaining subwindows reflow to fill — the source closes "on
 * dragging", not just on the drop. This is a render-only preview: the store
 * layout is NOT mutated, so an aborted/Escaped drag restores instantly and the
 * dragged tab's pane stays mounted in CenterPanel's flat pane layer (its PTY
 * survives; the floating ghost previews its content). The real source-group
 * collapse still happens in the store on commit (writeScope → pruneCollapse).
 *
 * Returns `layout` unchanged when there's nothing to collapse: no tab drag, the
 * dragged tab isn't the lone tab of its source group, it's the only subwindow
 * (nothing to expand into), or a group is fullscreen (its pane owns the panel).
