/**
 * "Someone else changed this too" — the answer to a CalDAV `412`
 * (`docs/caldav_plan.md` Phase 3).
 *
 * Mounted once at the shell, beside `CalDavSyncHost`, and for the same reason:
 * the edit that conflicts can be made from the calendar tab, the calendar
 * overlay, the to-do board or the header's day list, and the surface that would
 * otherwise carry the message is whichever of those the user has already closed.
 *
 * ## Why this exists at all
 *
 * A conflict means the resource changed on the server since this machine last
 * read it — from a phone, a web UI, a colleague's client. Both versions are real
 * edits and neither is obviously right, so the one thing that must not happen is
 * for the app to pick. The plan quotes mail encryption's rule for this, and it is
 * exactly the rule: *a silent downgrade is the single worst thing a sync feature
 * can do, because it looks exactly like success.*
 *
 * ## The three answers, and what each actually does
 *
 * - **Keep mine** re-reads the server's current ETag and writes against *that*.
 *   It is an overwrite, and it says so — but it is still a conditional one, so a
 *   third edit landing between this question and its answer conflicts again
 *   rather than being destroyed by the resolution of an older conflict.
 * - **Use the server's** forces a sync of the collection. That is what actually
 *   puts the server's version into `calendar.json`, through the same merge every
 *   other sync goes through, rather than through a special path that would have
 *   to re-derive what the merge already knows.
 * - **Decide later** drops the question and keeps the local edit. The row is not
 *   pushed and not overwritten; the next edit to it will ask again.
 *
 * There is deliberately **no "merge"** option. Two versions of an appointment
 * differ in fields whose combination nobody can be assumed to want — half of one
 * time and half of another is not a third valid meeting — and offering a merge
 * would mean inventing an edit the user never made.
