/**
 * The chart's two gestures — carrying a card, pulling a link out of a port —

 *
 * - **The release is bound at pointerdown**, synchronously, through
 *   `bindDragRelease`: WebKitGTK delivers `pointermove` but never the
 *   terminal event to a listener added mid-gesture, and it ends an ordinary
 *   drop with `pointercancel` rather than `pointerup`, which that binding
 *   turns into a commit where the engine means one.
 * - **Nothing moves until the threshold**, so a click is a click. The card
 *   that was pressed never moves at all: the ghost is drawn from this state,
 *   because the card can unmount mid-gesture when a write re-keys it.
 * - **Capture goes on `documentElement`** and only where the engine needs
 *   it — a capture target that unmounts drops the capture with a spurious
 *   cancel, and on Linux the implicit grab already delivers the release.
 * - **A commit with no zone does nothing**, which is what makes a cancel
 *   that commits safe: a card dropped over nothing stays where it was.
 *
 * Hit-testing reads rects the callers measured, never `elementFromPoint`, so
 * the same gesture runs under jsdom.
