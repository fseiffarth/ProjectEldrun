/**
 * Whether THIS OS window currently holds focus. Backs the "exactly one active
 * subwindow across all windows" rule (#42 ergonomics): each window keeps its own
 * focused-subwindow value, but only *paints* it as active while it owns OS focus,
 * so a blurred main window and a focused popout never both show a highlight.
 *
 * Defaults to `true` and only updates on a real boolean: the main window then
 * paints its active subwindow immediately on load (before the first event), and
 * in a non-Tauri context (unit tests, where `getCurrentWindow` is inert) the
 * value simply stays `true` — preserving the pre-gate behavior.
