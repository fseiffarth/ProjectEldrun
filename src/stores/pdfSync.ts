 * in the PDF; the PDF tab is a separate component (often already open), so the
 * TeX side posts the request here keyed by the absolute PDF path and `PdfCanvas`
 * for that path consumes it — scrolling the page into view and flashing a
 * highlight. The `nonce` lets a repeat reveal of the same spot fire again.
 *
 * #42 cross-window: the PDF may be popped out into a detached OS window, which is
 * a SEPARATE webview with its own Zustand heap — a local store write would never
 * reach it. So `requestReveal` also broadcasts the request over a global Tauri
 * event; every window registers `listenPdfReveal` and applies an incoming reveal
 * to its own store, so whichever window hosts the PDF reveals it. The originating
 * window stamps `from` and skips its own echo (it already applied it locally).
