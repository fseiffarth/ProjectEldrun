 *   on every keystroke and nothing renders off it, the same reason `activity.ts`
 *   keeps its per-PTY maps outside React). Counters are flushed to the backend on
 *   an interval and on window close, so a burst of typing costs one whole-file
 *   rewrite per flush rather than one per key.
 * - **Reading** — the zustand store proper, holding the report the recap renders.
 *
 * Scopes are the same ids tabs use: a project id, or `"root"` for the root
 * terminal.
