/**
 * Mediates the confirmation every **byte-sync transfer** now asks for.
 *
 * Byte-sync's two manual transfers each write one side's bytes over the other's:
 * a pull replaces the local mirror with the host's copy, a push replaces the
 * host's copy with the mirror's. Both used to be a single unconfirmed click — on
 * a file, on a *folder*, or on the whole project — which is fine when the
 * receiving side holds nothing and is data loss when it holds edits nobody else
 * has. From the button alone the two cases are indistinguishable, so the click
 * itself was the hazard: nothing about it said which one you were in.
 *
 * So every transfer asks first, and asks *with numbers*: how many files would
 * move, how many land on top of an existing file, and — the one that matters —
 * how many of those carry changes that exist nowhere else. The count comes from
 * the backend's read-only `sync_transfer_preview`, which walks exactly what the
 * transfer would walk (exclusions included).
 *
 * The store owns the whole lifecycle so a caller only awaits an answer
 * (`request()` resolves, never rejects) — the same bargain `hpcGuardPrompt` and
 * `hostKeyPrompt` strike. Nothing is remembered between prompts: a confirmation
 * that could be worn down by ticking "don't ask again" is not a gate, and each
 * transfer is a specific act rather than a policy.
 *
 * A **failed** preview never becomes a silent yes: the dialog says it could not
 * price the transfer and still requires the click.
 *
 * The same gate also fronts the orange view's **delete-the-other-copy** actions
 * (`SyncDeleteRequest`): not a transfer, but destructive to one side in exactly
 * the way a forced transfer is — and worse, since the copy it removes is the
 * file's last one anywhere. One dialog for both, so no second copy of the
 * question can drift.
