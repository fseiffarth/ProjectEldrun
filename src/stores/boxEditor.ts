 * Open/closed state for the Box editor dialog (`BoxEditorDialog`), mounted once
 * in `AppShell` (the RemoteMachines host pattern) so it can be opened from any
 * of its four doors — the box chip's menu, a pill's Boxes group, the multi-select
 * "Box these…" action, and the switcher's "+" menu — without prop-drilling.
 *
 * `boxId: null` is CREATE mode (a new box, `initialMemberIds` pre-checked);
 * a non-null `boxId` edits that box. The dialog itself carries a box selector,
 * so an editor opened on one box can move to another without a round trip here.
