 * while everything is folded away, and which member has to come back OUT of the
 * fold because it is no longer nominal.
 *
 * Each widget self-reports rather than the cluster re-deriving six states from
 * six different stores: the widget already computed its own lamp (VPN's
 * `off|connecting|connected`, Machines' lamp buckets, Mobile's tone), and a
 * second copy of that logic in the cluster would drift the moment either side
 * changed. A report is therefore a *summary* of a reading the widget was making
 * anyway, not a new measurement — nothing here polls.
 *
 * Widgets report from an effect, so a widget that renders nothing at all (its
 * feature is off) reports `null` and simply is not a member: the cluster never
 * counts it, never folds it, and never lets it colour the summary lamp.

/**
 * How loudly a member is speaking.
 *  - `off`       → present but dormant (no tunnel, no machines, nothing to say).
 *  - `ok`        → nominal. Folds away; contributes green to the summary lamp.
 *  - `attention` → transient and worth watching (a tunnel mid-connect).
 *  - `alert`     → wrong (offline, a machine erroring, a nearly flat battery).
 *
 * `attention` and `alert` **escalate**: that member is rendered in the bar even
 * while the cluster is collapsed. This is the whole reason a fold is safe —
 * folding hides five green lamps you had learned to ignore, and hides nothing
 * you would have acted on.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT escalated: anything that toggles on ordinary work. A CPU
 * spike during a build, a Mobile status flipping to "checking" every poll, a
 * fleet reconnecting at launch — each would pop a widget in and out of a bar
 * that is supposed to sit still, which is worse than the crowding this fixes.
 * Those report `ok` and stay folded; the expanded state is one click away.
